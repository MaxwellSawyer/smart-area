> Textareas on Steroids - just adding an AngularJS directive

# Features

* Word highlighting (syntax, keywords... ) with support for multiple sets
* Autocomplete
* Dropdown suggestions (mention users after typing @, hashtag support, keywords... )
* Minimal configuration required, but highly customizable if necessary

# Examples

(GIF screen recordings will be here)

# API

# CSS
The directive doesn't force any styles on the dropdown or textareas so that you can fully integrate it with your design. I would recommend using the stylesheet from the repo, and then modifiying to suit your needs.
